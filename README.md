Use of AI: 
    Debugging typescript errors in the frontend - not 100%, but enough to mention it
    Design system, I pretty much used Subframe UI heavily, I edited tailwind where it was necessary
    In the backend I used AI from Google Overview. If I couldnt find what I needed there I used Stackoverflow.
